	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>This software collects real time data about car sharing stations
		and vehicles (currently of South Tyrol) and stores the data into the
		integreen platform. The integreen platform is a central database where
		many real time data are collected. Data sources are components of the
		integreen system that collects data from specific APIs and writes to a
		common database structure.
	<h2>2. Compiling &amp; running</h2>
	<p>This is a java dynamic web (j2ee) project. It uses maven as
		uniform build system. The pom.xml file contains all specs about
		compiling, dependencies and running this project.
	<ul>
		<li>run &amp; debug the project using an embedded tomcat: <code>mvn
				tomcat7:run</code>
		<li>compile and create war for deploy: <code>mvn package</code>
	</ul>
	<h2>3. Configuration</h2>
	<p>This project uses only one java servlet for scheduling tasks and
		for the simple report.
	<ul>
		<li>it.bz.tis.integreen.carsharingbzit.ConnectorServlet
	</ul>
	<p>The servlet is configured in the web.xml file. Parameters for
		the servlet are:
	<ul>
		<li><b>endpoint</b>: the url for the car sharing web service
		<li><b>user/password</b>: authentication
		<li><b>cityUIDs</b>: a comma separated list of ID of the city the
			servlet must get the real time data
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>Important</b>: the servlet must be configured with the tag "
		&lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;" because the servlet
		starts the scheduler thread, otherwise the scheduler will not start
		immediately.
	<p>The project uses log4j as logging library. To configure log4j
		edit the file
	<ul>
		<li>src/main/resources/log4j2.xml
	</ul>
	<h2>4. Scheduler</h2>
	<p>
		The main java class is
		<code>it.bz.tis.integreen.carsharingbzit.ConnectorServlet</code>
		. This servlet, during the init process, creates a new background
		thread. The background thread polls the car sharing API each 10 minute.
		At the moment this time is stored into this constant:
	<pre>it.bz.tis.integreen.carsharingbzit.ConnectorLogic

   final static long INTERVALL = 10L * 60L * 1000L;
</pre>
	<p>
		The
		<code>INTERVALL</code>
		constant can be changed as desired, but please remember that it must
		fit one hour. Example of valid values are: 1 minute, 2 minute, 3
		minute, 4 minute, 5 minute, 6 minute, 10 minute. 7, 8, 9 minute are
		examples of not valid values.
	<p>This connector makes two kind of synchronization. The first is
		about "static" data and the second is about real time data. During the
		"static" synchronization values,  that do not change
		frequently, are copied: car sharing station list and vehicle list. This data is
		synchronized only once a day. The time when this is done is defined
		in the main Servlet in the following method:
	<pre>
it.bz.tis.integreen.carsharingbzit.ConnectorLogic

   static boolean isTimeForAFullSync(long time)
   {
      Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
      cal.setTimeInMillis(time);
      return cal.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == 12 &amp;&amp; cal.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == 00;
   }

</pre>
	<p>At the moment the servlet is configured to run a synchronization
		of "static" data at 12:00 pm each day.
	<p>
		<b>Important:</b> if you change the minute, please pay attention that
		this must match the INTERVALL constants
	<p>Each INTERVALL (10 minute) real time data are synchronized. Real
		time data contains the following informations:
	<ul>
		<li>How much vehicles are free/occupied in a station now and
			forecast
		<li>for each vehicle if is free/occupied now and forecast
	</ul>
	<p>
	<h2>5. Packages and important classes</h2>
	package
	<b>it.bz.tis.integreen.carsharingbzit</b>
	<p>
		This package contains the core classes: the servlet (
		<code>ConnectorServlet</code>
		) that starts the scheduler and the business logic (
		<code>ConnectorLogic</code>
		). The business logic contains all the code to read, convert and write
		data from car sharing system to integreen.
	<p>
		package <b>it.bz.tis.integreen.carsharingbzit.api</b>
	<p>This package contains all model classes for the car sharing api.
		Examples are: City, Vehicle and so on.
	<p>
		The class
		<code>ApiClient</code>
		is the "main" class used to send request to the car sharing system and
		read responses.
	<p>
		package <b>it.bz.tis.integreen.carsharingbzit.tis</b>
	<p>This package contains integreen extended classes to write data
		into the integreen database. It reuses integreen DTO classes.
	<h2>6. Activity report</h2>
	<p>If you open the web application with a browser (like
		http://www.ddddddd.xyz/carsharing-ds), a report is returned. The
		report shows the last 1000 activities with timestamp, what was done and
		status. In case of problems you can look at log4j files too.
